# Project Roadmap

## Vision

Build a simple, reliable JSON-driven portfolio builder that works well for personal use and can be shared with others who find it useful.

---

## Short Term (Next few months)

### Core Stability
- Fix remaining bugs in import/export workflow
- Restore full blog preview functionality  
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Write basic documentation (setup, usage, examples)

### Polish Existing Features
- Better validation error messages
- Smoother dashboard experience
- Sample portfolio examples for reference

---

## Medium Term (3-6 months)

### Small Improvements
- Basic search/filter for projects
- Simple theme options (dark mode, custom colors)
- Better mobile experience
- More sample templates and examples

### Optional Enhancements
- Consider basic user authentication (if needed)
- GitHub integration for automatic project imports (if useful)
- Improved blog management features

---

## Long Term (When I feel like it)

### Organic Growth
- Add features based on actual usage and feedback
- Keep things simple and maintainable
- Focus on what actually gets used

### Maybe Someday
- Multi-user support (if there's demand)
- Plugin system for custom fields
- Better deployment options

---

## Not Planning

- Complex enterprise features
- AI-powered anything
- Blockchain integration
- Massive scalability features
- Commercial SaaS platform

---

## Philosophy

This is primarily a personal project that solves a real problem. Features get added when they're actually needed, not because they sound cool. The goal is to keep it simple, functional, and maintainable for the long term.
